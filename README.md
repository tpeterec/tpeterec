### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently going through the 18 week Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp with Galvanize Inc utilizing my CSP opportunity with my last few months of my military service. On the side I am currently learning Java within a Master Class on Udemy, and studying for my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. My ultimate goal is to be a Software Engineer and work with AWS services!
