### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alex
I am currently going through the 18 week Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp with Galvanize Inc utilizing my CSP opportunity with my last few months of my military service. On the side I am currently learning Java within a Master Class on Udemy, and studying for my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. My ultimate goal is to be a Software Engineer and work with AWS services!

Check out my most recent project: fs_pet_shop (Using PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs, and Express.JS to make a server side project with a petshop inventory)
