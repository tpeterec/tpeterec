### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alex
I am currently going through the 18 week Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp with Galvanize Inc as I transfer to civilian life from the United States Army. On the side I am currently learning Java within a Master Class and studying for my AWS Solutions Architect Certification on Udemy. My ultimate goal is to be a Software Engineer and work with AWS!
