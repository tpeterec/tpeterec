### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alex
I am a Software Engineer at Wells Fargo, where I develop and maintain software solutions for the Credit Card Benefits Team using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Apache Kafka, and MongoDB. I joined Wells Fargo through the VET (Veteran Employment Transition) Program, a full-time, 8-week apprenticeship that provides me with on-the-job training and mentorship. I am passionate about developing software that can enhance the lives of others while also being intellectually stimulating. 

Before becoming a Software Engineer, I completed an 18-week Software Engineering Bootcamp with Galvanize Inc, where I learned the fundamentals of full-stack development in JavaScript, React, Express/Node.js, PostgreSQL and learned the fundamentals of cloud technology. I completed this program as a part of my DoD SkillBridge/ Army CSP, setting me up for a successful transition to civilian life towards the end of my Army service.
