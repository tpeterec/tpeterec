### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alex
Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a US Army Veteran and just completed a 18 week Software Engineering Bootcamp with Galvanize Inc. This bootcamp gave me multiple skillsets culminating to become a Full Stack Software Engineer. As I look for my first role as a Software Engineer,  I am going through a Java Masterclass on udemy learning Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms, Data Structures, and studying for my AWS Solutions Architect exam.
